# lunchbot
Slack bot for managing lunch orders

Extremely crude, yet nice 'n functional.

`@mention` lunchbot along with any of the following:
- `help`
- `where (this doesn't really do anything)`
- `orders`
- `reset`

anything else is considered a lunch order!

lunchbot is always happy to be alive.
