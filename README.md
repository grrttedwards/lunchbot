# lunchbot
Slack bot for managing lunch orders

Extremely crude, yet nice 'n functional.

### First,
`pip install slackclient schedule`

### Then,
Type a message to `@lunchbot` along with any of the following:
- `help`  - gives you usage help!
- `where` - (this doesn't really do anything)
- `orders`  - lists all the orders for you. nice and tidy!
- `reset` - burns everyone's lunch orders and starts fresh

anything else is considered a lunch order!

### As Always,
lunchbot is happy to be alive.
